
IDEAS / TO DO

- would like to wrap up all the various tools & modes in a GUI :-)


2012

 - at last, the batch processing will now take any input file and process it accordingly
 - the actual component still called the CreditCardBatchProcessor though it does all files now
 - BUT there's a runner class to point it at a folder which is named accordingly:
 
 	> AccountsBatchProcessorRunner


NOTE - the credit card reader uses the Command Pattern paradigm and runs in a whole different way
See it's documentation file for how to run it


October 2011 - Batch

** run class AccountsDataReader with the "BATCHMODE" argument **

OR

** if it's in the workspace, hack AccountsDataReaderBatchModeRunner to suit the run **


> improved the batch processing for account estat data files
> only ran it from the workspace
> the following hsould be noted:
	> just put all the data files into a working directory & produce a list file of them
	> the data files do NOT have to follow a nameing convention now but...
		> use spaces to delimit the text in them
		> inlcude the YEAR
		> include the month (either in full or just 3 letter abr)
		> if its NOT joint, need to put 'simon' in it
	> ONLY did the account data files in a single batch at this time
	
NOTE: - didn't use the command pattern code... should really get that unified with the batch approach
so, in other words, when I do a batch, the filename instances should produce a command... THEN should
be able to do a mixed batch quite easily.

ALSO... should allow the 'batch' approach to have simply process the contents of a directory... the 
list file is still valid though in case you want to include files in other locations OR only use a 
sub-set of the files in a given location.
