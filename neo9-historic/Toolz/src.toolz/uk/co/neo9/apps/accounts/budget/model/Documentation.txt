What this is

Budget is a model for capturing the monthly (initially) totals that the Trackers use.
It will be used as the baseline against which the actuals from the WIP Trackers can be judged
The idea is that eventually it can be built up via "rules" so that it becomes user-specifiable
Initially I'll just replicate the ammounts I have in the WIPs
I could build a simple CSV loader for it or even a hardcoded factory for initial use
