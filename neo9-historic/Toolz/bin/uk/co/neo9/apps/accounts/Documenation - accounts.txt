STARTING POINT:

> single point of entry is AccountsDataReader
> once it sorts out if its batch/single mode,
> it reads in the file as lines
> The lines are then set on models
> The model type is determined by meta-data
> the first & last line for a given model is also meta-data driven
> the meta-data is obtained from the input file type
> once all the file lines have been assigned to models,
> the models are sorted (? for date descending?)
> then the models process & output the raw text lines in one call
> the output() call stores the transaction data in the model instance fields
> and then loads a StringBuffer with the field data in order
> the StringBuffer returns a String line for the transaction
> the output line is stored in an ArrayList
> the ArrayList is finally written out to a text file

Voila!!!


THE UPDATE WILL:





-------------- OLD ----------------------

- the output is currently created like this:

> AccountsDataReader.AccountsData gets loaded with the data lines
> when output() is called upon it, it processes the raw data lines
> processed data gets set in the instance fields
> finally all instance fields get written in order to a StringBuffer

=> need to determine what type of output is required & 
the simply change the order... if I hadn't re-written the application, that is!!!
