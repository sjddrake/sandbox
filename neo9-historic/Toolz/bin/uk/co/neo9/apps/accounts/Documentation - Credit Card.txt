Documentation - Credit Card

How to run:

Use CreditCardBatchProcessorRunner

	- this reads the contents of the working folder so doesn't take a list file as input
	- it does need a certain amount of naming convention to the data fiels
	- another way of doing 'batch' is just to have multiple months of transactions in the same txt file! :-)

The adobe scrape is the last one that I worked on

It does work but if the pdf wont do a full line in one go, have to re-constitute the columns
in a spready and save the text from there. REMEMBER to text replace any tabs for spaces!
